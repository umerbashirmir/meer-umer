        "   - Random sampling ensures that the sample accurately reflects the characteristics of the entire population.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Reduces Bias**:\n",
        "   - By giving each population member an equal chance of selection, random sampling minimizes systematic errors or favoritism.\n",

Discrete random variables represent countable outcomes, while continuous random variables represent measurable quantities that can take on an infinite number of values within a range. Understanding the type of random variable helps in selecting the appropriate method to analyze the data and calculate probabilities."
