        "Answer : In Python, the difference between a **function** and a **method** is primarily based on how they are defined and used:\n",
        "1. **Function**:\n",
        "   - A function is a block of code that can be defined anywhere in the program, and it is not tied to any specific object or class.\n",
        "   - It is called by its name followed by parentheses.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Method:\n",
        "   - A method is a function that is associated with an object, typically defined within a class.\n",
        "   - It is called on an instance of the class (or on the class itself if it is a class method)\n",
        "    and has access to the instance (`self`) or the class itself (`cls`).\n",
        "\n",

        "   - Parameters are the variables listed inside the function definition. They define what kind of input the function expects.\n",
        "   - For example, in the function `def add(x, y):`, `x` and `y` are parameters.\n",
        "\n",

        "   - Arguments are the actual values passed to the function when it is called.\n",
        "   - For example, in the function call `add(3, 5)`, `3` and `5` are arguments.\n",

        "### 1. **Defining and Calling a Regular Function**\n",
        "\n",
        "A regular function is defined using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parameters.\n",

        "### 2. **Defining and Calling a Function with Default Arguments**\n",
        "\n",
        "You can provide default values for function parameters. If no argument is passed during the function call, the default value will be used.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",
        "# Function definition with a default argument\n",
        "def greet(name, message=\"Hello\"):\n",
        "    return f\"{message}, {name}!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# Function call with a default message\n",

        "\n",
        "- `*args` allows the function to accept a variable number of positional arguments.\n",

        "\n",
        "A **lambda function** is a small anonymous function defined with the `lambda` keyword. It's typically used for short, simple operations.\n",

        "### 5. **Function Call with Return Value**\n",
        "\n",
        "A function can return a value, which can be used directly or assigned to a variable.\n",

        "### 6. **Function Call Using Function as an Argument**\n",
        "\n",
        "You can pass one function as an argument to another function.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",
        "# Function definition that accepts another function as an argument\n",
        "def apply_function(func, value):\n",
        "    return func(value)\n",

        "\n",
        "### Summary of Ways to Define and Call a Function in Python:\n",
        "1. **Regular Function**: `def func():` and call it as `func()`.\n",
        "2. **With Default Arguments**: `def func(name, message=\"Hello\")` and call it as `func(name)`.\n",
        "3. **With Variable-Length Arguments**: Use `*args` or `**kwargs` in the function definition.\n",
        "4. **Lambda Function**: An anonymous function defined with `lambda`.\n",

        "# Question 4 : What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "Answer : The `return` statement in a Python function is used to **exit** the function and **send a result back** to the caller.\n",
        "It allows a function to return a value (or multiple values) after performing its task, making the result accessible outside of the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Purpose of `return`:\n",
        "1. **Exit the Function**: When the `return` statement is executed, the function terminates, and no further code in the function is executed.\n",
        "2. **Return a Value**: The value provided after the `return` keyword is sent back to the caller.\n",
        " This value can then be used for further operations or displayed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Syntax:\n",
        "return <value>\n",
        "```\n",

        "print(result)  # Output: 8\n",
        "\n",
        "- In this case, the function `add()` calculates the sum of `x` and `y`, then returns the result (`8`), which is stored in the variable `result` and printed.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Returning Multiple Values**:\n",
        "You can return multiple values from a function by separating them with commas. Python automatically packs these into a tuple.\n",
        "\n",
        "def get_full_name(first_name, last_name):\n",

        "#### 3. **Returning None (Implicitly)**:\n",
        "If a function does not explicitly return a value, it returns `None` by default.\n",

        "- The function `greet()` does not have a `return` statement, so it returns `None` by default. This value is stored in the variable `result`, and printing it shows `None`.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Exiting a Function Early**:\n",
        "The `return` statement can also be used to exit the function early before reaching the end of the function body.\n",

        "def check_even_or_odd(number):\n",

        "so the function doesn't continue to execute any further code after the return.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 5. **Returning `None` Explicitly**:\n",
        "If you use `return` without any expression, the function will return `None`.\n",
        "\n",
        "def say_goodbye():\n",
        "    return  # Implicitly returns None\n",

        "A **generator** in Python is a type of iterable, like a list or a tuple, but unlike lists or tuples, **generators are lazy**,\n",
        " meaning they do not store all the values in memory at once. Instead, they generate values one at a time as you iterate over them.\n",

        "\n",
        "A **lambda function** in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the `lambda`\n",
        " keyword. Unlike regular functions defined with `def`, lambda functions are typically used for short,\n",
        "  simple operations that can be written in a single line of code.\n",

        "- **`arguments`**: A comma-separated list of arguments (similar to function parameters).\n",

        " is evaluated and returned automatically without the need for the `return` keyword.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Key Characteristics of Lambda Functions**:\n",
        "1. **Anonymous**: Lambda functions do not require a name (though you can assign them to a variable).\n",
        "2. **Single Expression**: Lambda functions can only contain a single expression; they cannot have multiple statements or a body like regular functions.\n",
        "3. **Short-lived**: Lambda functions are often used for small tasks and are typically used where functions are needed temporarily.\n",
        "\n",

        " (functions that take other functions as arguments), such as `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`.\n",
        "3. **In Data Processing**: Lambda functions are frequently used in operations like sorting, filtering,\n",

        "2. **Reduced Readability**: While lambda functions are concise, they can reduce readability\n",
