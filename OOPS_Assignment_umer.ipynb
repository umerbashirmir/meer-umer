        "Answer : The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Encapsulation**\n",
        "   - **Definition**: The bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class.\n",
        "    It also involves restricting direct access to some of the object's components, often achieved using access modifiers (e.g., private, protected, public).\n",
        "   - **Purpose**: To protect data from unintended interference and misuse, providing controlled access through methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Abstraction**\n",
        "   - **Definition**: The process of hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the essential features to the user.\n",
        "   - **Purpose**: To reduce complexity and increase efficiency by focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Inheritance**\n",
        "   - **Definition**: A mechanism by which one class (child/subclass) can inherit the attributes and methods of another class (parent/superclass).\n",
        "   - **Purpose**: To promote code reuse and establish a natural hierarchy between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **Polymorphism**\n",
        "   - **Definition**: The ability of a single interface or method to represent different underlying forms (e.g., different implementations).\n",
        "   This is often achieved through method overriding and method overloading.\n",
        "   - **Purpose**: To enable objects to be treated as instances of their parent class rather than their actual class, enhancing flexibility and scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **Classes and Objects (or Instantiation)**\n",
        "   - **Definition**:\n",
        "     - **Class**: A blueprint or template for creating objects, defining the data and behaviors (methods) they should have.\n",
        "     - **Object**: An instance of a class that holds specific data and can use the class's methods.\n",
        "   - **Purpose**: To model real-world entities in a structured and reusable manner.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "In Python, **method overloading** (the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different signatures) is not natively supported as in some other programming languages like Java or C++.\n",
        " Instead, Python achieves similar functionality using **default arguments**, **`*args`**, and **`**kwargs`** to allow a method to handle varying numbers and types of arguments.\n",
        "### Example of Simulated Method Overloading\n",
        "Here is an example demonstrating how you can simulate method overloading in Python:\n",
        "class Calculator:\n",
        "    def add(self, *args):\n",

        "print(calc.add(10, 20, 30, 40))  # Output: 100\n",
        "### Key Points\n",
        "1. **`*args`**:\n",
        "   - Allows you to accept a variable number of positional arguments.\n",
        "   - In the example above, `*args` enables the `add` method to accept any number of arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Default Arguments**:\n",
        "   - You can set default values for parameters to handle multiple cases in a single method.\n",

        "   Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Greeter:\n",

        "   print(greeter.greet())         # Output: Hello, Guest!\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Explicit Logic**:\n",

        "\n",
        "The **Method Resolution Order (MRO)** in Python defines the order in which classes are searched when executing a method or accessing an attribute.\n",
        " This is particularly relevant in inheritance scenarios, especially with **multiple inheritance**, to resolve conflicts and determine which class's method or attribute should be used.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python uses the **C3 Linearization (or C3 superclass linearization)** algorithm to determine the MRO. The algorithm ensures:\n",
        "1. A consistent order for method resolution.\n",
        "2. The parent class is considered before the derived class.\n",

        "1. The MRO for class `D` is `[D, B, C, A, object]`.\n",
        "2. When `d.process()` is called:\n",
        "   - Python looks in `D` first (the class of the instance).\n",
        "   - Then it looks in `B` (the first parent of `D` in the MRO).\n",
        "   - Since `process` is found in `B`, it stops searching\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Significance of MRO**\n",
        "1. **Multiple Inheritance Conflict Resolution**: Ensures consistent method resolution.\n",

        "   - The `__str__` method is called when you use `print()` or `str()` on an object.\n",
        "   - In this example, the `__str__` method is overridden to return a formatted string representation of the `Point` object in the form `\"Point(x, y)\"`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`__add__` Method**:\n",
        "   - The `__add__` method is called when you use the `+` operator between two objects.\n",
        "   - In this example, when two `Point` objects are added together, the `__add__` method adds their corresponding `x` and `y` coordinates to create a new `Point` object with the summed values.\n",
        "   - The method checks if the `other` object is also an instance of `Point`. If not, it returns `NotImplemented`, which tells Python that the operation is not supported for these objects.\n",

        "1. Python’s C3 Linearization algorithm ensures a consistent and deterministic method resolution order (MRO).\n",
