        "# Question 1 :  Discuss string slicing and provide examples.\n",
        "Answer : String slicing is a powerful feature in Python that allows you to extract a portion (substring) of a string by specifying a range of indices.\n",
        " It is similar to slicing in lists and other sequences.\n",
        "Basic Syntax\n",
        "The basic syntax for string slicing is:\n",
        "string[start:end:step]\n",
        "start: The index where the slice starts (inclusive). If not provided, defaults to the beginning of the string (index 0).\n",
        "end: The index where the slice ends (exclusive). If not provided, defaults to the end of the string.\n",
        "step: The step size (optional). It determines how many characters to skip between each character in the slice. If not provided, defaults to 1.\n",
        "Key Points:\n",
        "Indexing: Strings are indexed starting from 0. Negative indices count from the end of the string (-1 is the last character).\n",
        "Start and End: The slice includes the character at the \"start\" index but excludes the character at the \"end\" index.\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "1. Basic Slicing\n",
        "text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
        "print(text[0:5])  # Output: 'Hello'\n",
        "Here, the slice starts at index 0 (inclusive) and ends at index 5 (exclusive), so it includes \"H\", \"e\", \"l\", \"l\", \"o\".\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Omitting Start and End\n",
        "text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
        "print(text[:5])  # Output: 'Hello' (from the start to index 5)\n",
        "print(text[7:])  # Output: 'World!' (from index 7 to the end)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Using Negative Indices:\n",
        "text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
        "print(text[-6:-1])  # Output: 'World' (starts from 6th last character to the last but one)\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Slicing with a Step\n",
        "text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
        "print(text[::2])  # Output: 'Hlo ol!' (every second character from the whole string)\n",
        "In this case, the step size is 2, meaning we take every second character.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Slicing with Negative Step\n",
        "text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
        "print(text[::-1])  # Output: '!dlroW ,olleH' (reverses the string)\n",
        "A step of -1 reverses the string, so the characters are taken from the end to the beginning.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Slicing with a Step and Specific Indices\n",
        "text = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
        "print(text[1:10:3])  # Output: 'el r' (starts from index 1 to 10, taking every 3rd character)\n",
        "Edge Cases\n",
        "Empty String:\n",
        "\n",
        "text = \"Python\"\n",
        "print(text[10:])  # Output: '' (Index out of range, but returns an empty string)\n",
        "Out of Range Indices:\n",
        "\n",
        "text = \"Python\"\n",
        "print(text[0:100])  # Output: 'Python' (The end index exceeds the string length, so the whole string is returned)\n",

        "#Question 2 :Explain the key features of lists in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: In Python, lists are one of the most versatile and commonly used data structures.\n",
        "A list is an ordered collection of items, which can be of any data type, including numbers, strings, other lists, or even mixed types.\n",
        " Below are the key features of lists in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Ordered:\n",
        "Lists maintain the order of the elements in which they are inserted. This means that the order in which items are added to the list will be preserved\n",
        " when accessed.\n",
        "Indexing can be used to retrieve elements in the list by their position (starting from 0 for the first element).\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "print(my_list[0])  # Output: 1 (first element)\n",
        "print(my_list[2])  # Output: 3 (third element)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Mutable:\n",
        "Lists are mutable, meaning that the elements of a list can be changed after it is created. You can modify, add, or remove elements from a list.\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "my_list[1] = 5  # Modify second element\n",
        "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 5, 3, 4]\n",
        "3. Dynamic Size:\n",
        "Lists in Python can grow or shrink in size dynamically. You can add or remove elements without worrying about the initial size of the list.\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2]\n",
        "my_list.append(3)  # Add an element at the end\n",
        "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\n",

        "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 3]\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Heterogeneous:\n",
        "A list can store elements of different types. You can have integers, strings,\n",
        "or even other lists as elements within the same list.\n",
        "my_list = [1, \"hello\", 3.14, [1, 2]]\n",

        "print(my_list[3])  # Output: [1, 2]\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Indexed Access:\n",
        "Lists are indexed, meaning that elements can be accessed using their position (index) within the list. Python supports both positive (starting from 0)\n",
        " and negative indices (starting from -1 for the last element).\n",
        "my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]\n",
        "print(my_list[-1])  # Output: 40 (last element)\n",
        "print(my_list[-2])  # Output: 30 (second last element)\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Slicing:\n",
        "Lists support slicing, allowing you to extract a sublist (a portion of the list) by specifying a range of indices.\n",
        " This makes it easy to retrieve parts of a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n",

        "print(my_list[:3])   # Output: [10, 20, 30] (first three elements)\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Supports Iteration:\n",
        "You can iterate over the elements of a list using loops, such as for loops. This allows you to process each element in the list.\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "for item in my_list:\n",
        "    print(item)\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Built-in Methods:\n",
        "Python provides several built-in methods to perform common operations on lists. Some of the most commonly used methods are:\n",
        "append(): Adds an element to the end of the list.\n",
        "insert(): Adds an element at a specific index.\n",
        "remove(): Removes the first occurrence of an element.\n",
        "pop(): Removes and returns an element at a specific index (or the last element by default).\n",
        "sort(): Sorts the elements of the list in ascending order.\n",
        "reverse(): Reverses the order of the list.\n",
        "extend(): Adds multiple elements to the list.\n",
        "count(): Counts the occurrences of an element in the list.\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "my_list.append(5)  # Add 5 at the end\n",
        "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
        "\n",
        "my_list.remove(3)  # Remove the first occurrence of 3\n",
        "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 4, 5]\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Nested Lists:\n",
        "Lists can contain other lists as elements, creating a multi-dimensional structure, like matrices or lists of lists.\n",
        "nested_list = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]\n",
        "print(nested_list[1])  # Output: [3, 4] (accessing a sublist)\n",
        "print(nested_list[1][0])  # Output: 3 (accessing an element in the nested list)\n",
        "10. List Comprehensions:\n",
        "Python supports list comprehensions, which provide a concise way to create lists. These are particularly useful for transforming or filtering data.\n",
        "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
        "squared = [x**2 for x in numbers]  # Creating a list of squares\n",
        "print(squared)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]\n",

        "A set is a built-in data type in Python that represents an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are highly useful for operations that involve membership testing, uniqueness, and mathematical set operations like union, intersection, and difference. Here are the key features of sets in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "# 1. **Unordered Collection**\n",
        "- Sets do not maintain the order of elements. The order in which elements are inserted is not guaranteed to be preserved when the set is printed or iterated over.\n",
        "\n",

        "1. **Hashing**: Immutable keys are hashable, which means they have a consistent hash value that\n",
        "can be used by the dictionary to quickly locate the corresponding value.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Integrity**: Using immutable keys ensures that the dictionary's structure remains intact, as the key\n",
        "cannot be changed after insertion. This guarantees correct lookup and retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Performance**: Since the hash value of immutable keys is stable, dictionary operations like lookup, insertion, and deletion are optimized for efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Data Consistency**: Immutable keys prevent unexpected side effects that could occur if keys were mutable,\n",
        "preserving data consistency and ensuring that the dictionary functions as expected.\n",

        "By enforcing immutability, Python ensures that dictionaries maintain their integrity, efficiency, and performance."
