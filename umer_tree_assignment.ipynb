        "#1. What is a Decision Tree, and how does it work\n",
        "\n",
        "#Ans. A **Decision Tree** is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.\n",
        "It is a tree-like model of decisions, where each node represents a feature (attribute), each branch represents a\n",
        "decision rule, and each leaf node represents an outcome (class label or numerical value).\n",
        "\n",
        "### **How It Works:**\n",
        "1. **Splitting:**\n",
        "   - The dataset is split into subsets based on feature values.\n",
        "   - The algorithm selects the best feature to split the data using criteria like **Gini Impurity**,\n",
        "   **Entropy (Information Gain)**, or **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** (for regression).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Decision Nodes and Branches:**\n",
        "   - At each node, the data is further split based on specific conditions.\n",
        "   - This process continues recursively, creating branches.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Leaf Nodes:**\n",
        "   - The process stops when a stopping criterion is met (e.g., maximum depth, minimum samples per leaf).\n",
        "   - Each leaf node represents a class label (classification) or a predicted value (regression).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Pruning (Optional):**\n",
        "   - To avoid overfitting, unnecessary branches are removed using **pre-pruning** (limiting depth, minimum samples per split)\n",
        "   or **post-pruning** (removing branches after training).\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Example of a Decision Tree:**\n",
